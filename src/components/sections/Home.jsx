                I am a web developer with over 8 years of experience in web development, specializing in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have a strong background in ASP .NET MVC, ASP .NET Core and MS SQL Server, also particularly with stored procedures, gained from maintaining complex systems in my early career. More recently, I’ve focused on front-end development and am actively enhancing my skills in React and Angular. I’m passionate about creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces and am excited about opportunities that challenge me to grow further in modern front-end and back end frameworks."
